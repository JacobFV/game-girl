# Game Boy Simulator Architecture

## Project Overview
This project creates a virtual Game Boy simulator with multiple games and networking capabilities. Users can create multiple Game Boy devices, load different games onto them, and even connect devices for multiplayer experiences.

## Core Components

### 1. Game Boy Device
- Visual representation of a Game Boy with buttons, frame, and screen
- Handles button inputs
- Renders game output on canvas
- Manages game lifecycle (load, start, pause, reset)
- Supports networking for multiplayer games

### 2. Game Library
- Base Game class with common functionality
- Multiple game implementations across different genres:
  - Adventure games
  - Learning games
  - Platform games
  - Skill games
  - Story games
  - Social games
  - Utility games (calculator, web browser)
  - AI games (chat game)

### 3. UI Components
- Game Boy device rendering
- Game selection interface
- Drag and drop functionality
- Device management (add/remove)
- Network visualization
